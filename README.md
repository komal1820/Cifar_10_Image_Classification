# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This repository contains code and documentation for a project focused on image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to build machine learning models capable of accurately classifying images into one of ten categories.

## Overview

CIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The task is to classify these images into categories such as "airplane," "automobile," "bird," "cat," "deer," "dog," "frog," "horse," "ship," and "truck."
